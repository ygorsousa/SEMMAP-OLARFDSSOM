# Incremental Semantic Mapping with Unsupervised On-line Learning

Semantic mapping approach with unsupervised, on-line and incremental learning, based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with time-varying structure. The approach was presented at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) in 2018 and is described in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8489430.
